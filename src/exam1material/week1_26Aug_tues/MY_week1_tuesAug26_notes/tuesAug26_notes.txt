What is this class?
- logical reasoning (basics, puzzles)
- writing formal statements (propositional and predicate logic)
- proofs (why?)
- reasoning about code
    - analyzing what we know
    - identifying equivalent programs
    - simplifying programs
    - formally describing what programs do
- basics of proving correctness of programs (why?)

HW 0 - due Thursday, August 28
    --> see how to do it

HW 1 - due Tuesday, September 2

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Taking a step back...what is logic?

- analysis of an argument according to a set of rules
- given a set of premises (and sometimes a conclusion)
- Sometimes the premises may not make sense 


- a VALID conclusion is one that is always true
    anytime all the premises are true


Note that the premises might make no sense!


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Premise 1: If a person wears a red shirt,
    then they don't like pizza.

Premise 2: Fred is wearing a red shirt.

Conclusion: Fred doesn't like pizza.



--> Is this a valid argument? YES* 



(is there a hidden assumption we're making about Fred?)
Yes, we are assuming that Fred is a person. Fred could be a Guinea Pig




////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Logical Arguments with "OR"
    - can be ambiguous! Why? exclusive vs inclusive


I order fries or I order chips. We assume this is exclusive because you get one or the other



- in English, how do we interpret "or"? 



- in programming? || inclusive




"Or" in THIS class: 
Inclusive unless otherwise stated

/////////////////////////////

Premise 1: I'll fold the laundry or I'll do the dishes.
Premise 2: I don't fold the laundry.

--> What can I conclude? 
I'll do the dishes because I do not do laundry



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

num = 5;
if (num < 4 || x >= 10) {
    statement;
}



Suppose we know "statement" is executed
--> What can we conclude? 

x >= 10 because the number is 5, so it is greater than 4, disproving the left side



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

x = 9;
if (num < 4 || x >= 10) {
    if (num > 2) {
        statement;
    }
}



Suppose we know "statement" is executed
--> What can we conclude? 
num < 4 for the outer, num <2 for the inner
Suppose num is an int
num is 3


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

What rule are we seeing with an "or" statement,
where we know that one of the statements is NOT true?

The other side is true




////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Logical Arguments with "IF/THEN" (aka "implies" -> )

If it is raining, then I will get wet.
It is raining.

--> What can I conclude? 




How to write with -> symbol?



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

When we have an "if/then" statement,
and we know that the "if" part is true?

    ...what can we always conclude?





/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

If I don't hear my alarm, then I will be late for class.
I am late for class.

--> What can I conclude?






/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

If I don't hear my alarm, then I will be late for class.
I hear my alarm.

--> What can I conclude? 








/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

If I don't hear my alarm, then I will be late for class.
I'm not late for class.

--> What can I conclude?




IF I don't hear my alarm THEN I will be late for class.

is equivalent to:





if (condition) {
    statement
}

--> what if we know statement is NOT executed? 



If p Then q

... is equivalent to?


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

More if/then logic in programming.


if (num < 4 || x >= 10) {

    y = 17;
}

--> suppose y is 17 here. What do we know?

Nothing: (Might have already been 17)


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

y = 10;
if (num < 4 || x >= 10) {

    y = 17;
}

--> suppose y is 17 here. Can we conclude anything now?

if (num < 4 || x >= 10) must have been true



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

if (num < 4 || x >= 10) {

    y = 17;
}

--> suppose y is NOT 17 here. What do we know?

if (num < 4 || x >= 10) must be false, num >= 4 AND x < 10
DeMorgan's Law


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Attendance/practice quiz in Canvas


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Logic puzzles.

The puzzles in this lecture are from or inspired by:
"What is the Name of This Book?", by Raymond Smullyan

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The island of Knights and Knaves.
Each inhabitant is either a knight or a knave.

Knights ALWAYS tell the truth, and knaves ALWAYS lie.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Who can say, "I'm a knave"? 

Can a knight?
Can a knave?



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You see two inhabitants, Eve and Fred.

Eve says, "I am a knave or Fred is a knight."



What are Eve and Fred? 



(what does the "or" mean?) 



Her WHOLE statement is the or -- we only need to whole statement
to be true, not each individual piece.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You see two different inhabitants, Ava and Bob.

Ava says that Bob is a knave.
Bob says, "Neither Ava nor I are knaves."



What are Ava and Bob?




What does "neither" mean?
    When is Bob's statement true? 
    When is Bob's statement false?
